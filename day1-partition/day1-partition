 * Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come 
 * before equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements 
 * less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not 
 * need to appear between the left and right partitions.
